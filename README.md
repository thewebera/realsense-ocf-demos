# RealSense OCF Demos
These samples illustrate how to develop applications using Intel® RealSense™ JavaScript [API](https://01org.github.io/node-realsense/doc/spec) and Open Connectivity Foundation™ ([OCF](https://openconnectivity.org)) JavaScript [API](https://github.com/01org/iot-js-api/tree/master/ocf).

## Architecture

## Demos
The following demos are provided in this release.
 - **Control light by distance**(demo1): This sample app illustrates the use of libRealsense, libPT, and the Linux SDK Framework to use the ZR300 camera's depth and color sensors to detect people in the scene. Detected person in the scene will be displayed with the distance information on screen. Meanwhile, the led lights will be on and off according to the person's position changing.
 - **Control light/buzzer by person recognition**(demo2)：This sample app illustrates how to register new users to the database, upload the database to identify them when they appear in the scene. Recognized person in the scene will light a green led, otherwise light a red one and open buzzer.

### Software

### Setup RealSense Execution Environment on Joule

1. Please refer to this [tutorial](https://github.com/01org/node-realsense/blob/master/doc/setup_environment.md) for details introduction.

2. [Create a WiFi hotspot on Ubuntu 16.04](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/04/create-wifi-hotspot-ubuntu-16-04-android-supported/) named like "realsense-ocf-demo".

3. There are some dependencies(uuid-dev, libcure4-openssl-dev and a C++ compiler (gcc-5 or later) etc.) need to install at first, you can install them via command:
   ```
   # sudo apt-get install uuid-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-all-dev sqlite3 glib2.0-dev
   ```
4. Install [`iotivity-node`](https://github.com/otcshare/iotivity-node) via command `npm install iotivity-node@1.2.0-1`, for detail information, please refer to [here](https://github.com/otcshare/iotivity-node/blob/master/README.md).

5. Execute belows commands to start this demo journey:
   ```bash
   # git clone https://github.com/thewebera/realsense-ocf-demos.git
   # cd realsense-ocf-demo
   ```
   Please follow below guide to set up ocf server environment at first, then you can enter directory "demo1" or "demo2", following the corresponding README file to launch the demo. 

### Setup OCF Server Test Environment on another Joule
1. Please follow this [instruction](https://github.com/intel/intel-iot-refkit/blob/master/doc/howtos/image-install.rst) to install
[iot-ref-kit image](http://iot-ref-kit.ostc.intel.com/download/builds/intel-iot-refkit_master/2017-05-31_21-43-10-build-204/images/intel-corei7-64/) which named like `refkit-image-gateway-intel-corei7-64-<build-version>.wic`.

2. Add Authorized Keys for Remote ssh Access
   In Yotoc Reference Kit OS Gateway images, root automatically gets logged in on a local console or serial port connection. You can enable remote access as root via ssh in your image by installing your personal public key in the `~root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

   You’ll first need to have a private/public key pair on your workstation to enable ssh access to the target device. You can use an existing host ssh key pair, found in $HOME/.ssh. A private/public key pair will be stored in two files for example, `.ssh/id_rsa` and `.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

   If you don’t see private/public key files, you’ll need to generate them, please refer to [here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) get more information about how to  generate an ssh key.

3. Please refer to this [guidance](./ocf-servers/README.md#setting-up-the-hw) to setup the sensors on this board

4. Copy the downloaded repo "realsense-ocf-demo/ocf-servers" from the RealSense board to this board, then launch all sensors server. Firewall has been setted up in file `init-ocf-server.sh`, you can run this file directly or execute step 5 manually.

5. Enter the Joule device and using below command to setup firewall:

    Note that when using the [IoT Reference OS Kit](https://github.com/intel/intel-iot-refki), its firewall will block the IoTivity network traffic by default. A brute-force approach is to disable the firewall altogether as follows:
    ```
    # systemctl disable iptables
    # systemctl disable ip6tables
    ```
    A better solution would be to open up just the ports that are required. Port 5683 is used by the CoAP protocol during the device discovery phase, 5684 is used for secured traffic (*note:* this will be used when IoTivity turns on the `SECURED` compile-time flag) and other (random) ports are used later to communicate with the device. If you wish to open up just the required ports, you can do so as follows:
    ```
    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5683 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5684 -j ACCEPT
    ```
    To open ports for the IPv6 traffic, do:
    ```
    # ip6tables -A INPUT -s fe80::/10 -p udp -m udp --dport 5683 -j ACCEPT
    # ip6tables -A INPUT -s fe80::/10 -p udp -m udp --dport 5684 -j ACCEPT
    ```
    A range of ports can also be specified as follows:
    ```
    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport <start>:<end> -j ACCEPT
    # ip6tables -A INPUT -s fe80::/10 -p udp -m udp --dport <start>:<end> -j ACCEPT
    ```
6. Enter to the Joule device and connect to WIFI "realsense-ocf-demo"
    ```

    ```
    This Joule must have one ip is same domain as the first Joule which setup realsense environment.

### Known issue:
- [#135](https://github.com/otcshare/iotivity-node/issues/135) Sometimes OCF Client can't find OCF Server resource
(This is a critical issue that will cause the demonstration unstable or failure, in order to avoid this issue, you could switch to `restapi` branch which is stable version)
- After connect the sensors to Joule board and power on this board, maybe sensor rgbled or buzzer is on, please ignore this behavior, once OS is loaded and the servers file are launched, the sensor will off.
